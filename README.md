# py-self-lensing

A Python module for generating and fitting light curves and radial velocity time series for self-lensing binaries. Includes three effects in light curves: self-lensing, Doppler boosting, and ellipsoidal variations. Includes eccentricity in RV, but not in light curves (yet).

## Installing

For now, this can be installed with `pip` directly from GitHub:

```shell
$ pip install git+https://github.com/COBALT-lensing/py-self-lensing.git
```

## Generating light curves and RV

The first step is to define the properties of your self-lensing system:

```python
from astropy import units
from selflensing.models import SelfLensingSystem

sls = SelfLensingSystem(
    a=1 * units.AU,
    b=0 * units.dimensionless_unscaled,
    Macc=9*units.M_sun,
    Mcomp=1*units.M_sun,
    Rcomp=10*units.R_sun
)
```

Then you can use the generators to produce simulated data:

```python
from astropy.time import Time
from selflensing.generators import LightcurveGenerator, RVGenerator

start_time = Time("2025-01-01")
end_time = Time("2026-01-01")
peak_time = Time("2025-06-01")

lcg = LightcurveGenerator(sls, start_time=start_time, end_time=end_time, peak_time=peak_time)
rvg = RVGenerator(sls, start_time=start_time, end_time=end_time, peak_time=peak_time)
```

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot

pyplot.scatter(lcg.times.jd, lcg.flux_array)
```
